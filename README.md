## Project Tile: 
StarWars Character Social Network Graph Mining Analysis

## Description:
This dataset contains the social network of Star Wars characters extracted from the movie scripts. If two characters speak together within the same scene, they have been connected.

## Project Idea
UPDATE REQUIRED

## Proposed Solution
Step 1: Data ingestion, data cleaning, and initial visualization (Required)

Step 2: Preprocessing as needed - as we decide on an appropriate approach, this step may or may not be required

Step 3: Analyze graphs for apparent trends and patterns.

Step 4: Analyze graphs with special attention to degree, page ranks, understand connections, states, and other factors that we hypothesize to have an impact on the social connections.

Step 5: Evaluate which factors/trends had the greatest impact on Network connectivity.
